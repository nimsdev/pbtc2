            <div class="righcolumntext">AlgaeCal, <br><br> I am a  designer &amp; developer entering my sixth year in this field. I have experience with front-end, backend, graphic design, and marketing. I am also experienced in responsive design, making websites ads, and applications look pleasant for desktop browsers, and mobile devices.
                <br>
                <br>
                
               I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, jQuery, and WooCommerce. The first site I worked on/started was schoolitup.com, and It was built with PHP, HTML, &amp; CSS. I gained experience with Wordpress and WooCommerce product management while I was managing a resort booking website, vacationdeals4all.com in the summer &amp; fall seasons of 2015.
                <br>
                
                <br> My portfolio will showcase my skill set as a talented creator, designer, and my solid understanding of development and design. My work will also show my ability to make interfaces great for web &amp; mobile users.
                <!--My responsibilities as a website manager, and my understanding of modern website and graphic design.

                <br>
                <br> I am located in Ottawa, and I am aware you are located in Vancouver. There is a section on the posting mention remote work is fine, hopefully that includes Ottawa. If you are looking for someone local, I understand. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or clarification of my work.
                <br>
                <br> Sincerely,
